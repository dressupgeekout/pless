# pless, the screen-oriented pager

**pless** is a lot like less(1), except that pages NEVER overlap. If reading
the output of less(1) is like reading a long scroll, then **pless** reads
like a book.

Also, unlike less(1), **pless** has FAR fewer options. And this program is
written in Ruby (but it really shouldn't).


## Usage

**pless [-l lines_per_page] [file]**

By default, pless pages "at" every (N-1) lines, where N is the height of the
terminal. (The last line displays some status info.) You can force pless to
page at some arbitrary interval with the **-l** option.

You can navigate a document with the following keys. They're like less(1):

  - **h**, **p** -- previous page
  - **l**, **n** -- next page
  - **g** -- first page
  - **G** -- last page
  - **q** -- quit


NOTE. There's a TODO: If a file is not provided, then pless should read
from the standard input. Right now I can't figure out how reconcile
Curses' getch() function and reading the initial data from stdin. The best
workaround for now is to use a named pipe:

    $ mkfifo work
    $ /do/something/to a_file > work &
    $ pless work
